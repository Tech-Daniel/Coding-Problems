# Validate Subsequence
Prompt: Given two non-empty arrays of integers `array`, write a function that determines whether the second array `sequence` is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] , and so do the numbers [2, 4] . Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

### Example:
input1:
array1 = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence1 = [1, 6, -1, 10]

output1:
isValidSubsequence(array1, sequence1)
true
